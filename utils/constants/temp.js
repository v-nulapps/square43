//     "missionShort": "At the time of our first meeting, Glasstic had a finished product and a clear (no pun intended) idea of its purpose. What remained was communication in every way possible, especially on socials and their new website-to-be.",
//     "missionLong": "This included not only a rework of their Social Media presence, but first and foremost, a complete makeover of their existing website. The focus needed to remain on the practicality of plastic glasses that look (and feel) exactly like glass, but we also realized that an extra touch was needed.",
//     "solutionShort": "This was our starting point: one established brand color, a finished product and an identity to build. Soon enough, we made a to-do list of our own: refurbish the website by adding color; clear out sections on the website for a cleaner look; include to-the-point product description.",
//     "solutionLong": "With a new set of bright colors and an optimized web layout, we can humbly claim that Glasstic is now nothing short of fantastic!",
